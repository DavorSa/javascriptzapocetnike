        I first found this number scrawled on the back of one of
        my notebooks a few years ago. Since then, it has often
        dropped by, showing up in phone numbers and the serial
        numbers of products that I've bought. It obviously likes
        me, so I've decided to keep it.

        // Exersizes

        /* Looping a triangle

        Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

        #
        ##
        ###
        ####
        #####
        ######
        #######
        It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

        var abc = "abc";
        console.log(abc.length);
        // → 3

        // Your code here.



        /* FizzBuzz

        Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers
        from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, 
        print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible 
        by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

        When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", 
        for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print 
        "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

        (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to 
        weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if 
        you solved it, you’re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
